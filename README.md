trino + hive + minio with postgres in docker compose






# Trino-Hive-Postgres-Minio Exercise

This is a personal exercise for me to understand Trino and its architecture, especially with 
Hive Metastore/ Postgres/ Minio. The idea of the exercise is originated from 
https://trino.io/blog/2020/10/20/intro-to-hive-connector.html. The only difference is that I 
changed the DB of Hive Metastore from MariaDB to PostgresDB and tried to implement it 
with k8s with the help of https://github.com/alexcpn/presto_in_kubernetes.

## Run Locally with Docker-compose
The implementation with docker-compose is referred to https://github.com/bitsondatadev/trino-getting-started/tree/main/hive/trino-minio 
with the help of https://github.com/bitsondatadev/hive-metastore/pull/2/commits to build a Hive Metastore image to
support PostgresDB.

Step 0 - Go to the docker-compose directory
```bash
cd docker-compose
```
Step 1 - Build a Hive Metastore image with the Dockerfile to support PostgresDB
```bash
docker build -t my-hive-metastore .
```
Step 2 - Implement with docker-compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Step 3 - Create Bucket in MinIO
- account: minio
- password: minio123

Step 4 - Into the runnung trino container
```bash
docker container exec -it docker-compose_trino-coordinator_1 trino
```
Step 5 -  Create schema and table and play around with trino, you can see the trino dashboard from localhost:8080.
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA minio.test
WITH (location = 's3a://test/');

CREATE TABLE minio.test.customer
WITH (
    format = 'ORC',
    external_location = 's3a://test/customer/'
) 
AS SELECT * FROM tpch.tiny.customer;
```

			
### (Optional: see the metadata store in Postgres)
Step 6 - Into the running postgres container
```bash 
docker exec -it "docker-compose_postgres_1" psql -U admin -d "hive_db"
```
Step 7 - Run SQL commands on postgresDB to see where the metadata is stored. 
```sql
SELECT
 "DB_ID",
 "DB_LOCATION_URI",
 "NAME", 
 "OWNER_NAME",
 "OWNER_TYPE",
 "CTLG_NAME"
FROM "DBS";
```

Step 8 - Close down the running containers
```bash
docker-compose down
```
